Overview
---

This is my learning project "finding lane line".

In this project, I will detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.

To complete the project, I make two files:
- Project code as html and jupyter notebook.
- A brief write up explaining my solution [code](https://github.com/hirotoshi8/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/P1.ipynb) and the [writeup_p_lane_line.md](https://github.com/hirotoshi8/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/writeup_p_lane_line.md).

The code file is called P1.ipynb and the writeup is writeup_p_lane_line.md 

These outputs is based on the specifications in the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/322/view)


About Writeup
---
In this writeup, it provides a detailed response to the "Reflection" section of the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/322/view). There are three parts to the reflection:

1. Describe the pipeline

2. Identify any shortcomings

3. Suggest possible improvements
